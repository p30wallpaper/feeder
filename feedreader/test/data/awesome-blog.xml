      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I received a brand new &lt;a href=&quot;http://oppostyle.com/find-5/9-find-5-midnight.html&quot;&gt;OPPO Find 5&lt;/a&gt;.
My previous one died after six months of use when it refused to charge.
Luckily, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://oppostyle.com/content/8-warranty&quot;&gt;warranty&lt;/a&gt; on it lasts for two years.
I mailed the broken phone back, and was sent a replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was of course thrilled when the &lt;a href=&quot;http://international.dhl.ca/en.html&quot;&gt;DHL&lt;/a&gt; delivery person arrived.
After answering the buzzer, I met with him at the front door of my apartment building.
He had another package with him, and said that its recipient sounded much more excited than I did.
The package was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.playstation.com/ps4/index.htm&quot;&gt;PS4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>KFC</title>

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been eating at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kfc.ca/&quot;&gt;KFC&lt;/a&gt; lately.
I am not sure why, but I have been having massive fried chicken cravings.
At KFC, I usually get their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kfc.ca/menu/menuImage.axd?Name=Sandwiches1&amp;amp;Section=Sandwiches&amp;amp;type=modal&quot;&gt;Zinger&lt;/a&gt; sandwich.
It is made up of one fried chicken breast, one piece of lettuce, spicy mayonnaise sauce, and two buns.
That is it.
It is pretty expensive too, costing $8.39 when gotten with fries and a drink.
I love it, but I have got to stop eating it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, I&amp;#39;d get a thin little notepad in my mailbox.
Written at the top of these notepads will be, in big capital letters, the name &amp;quot;Geoff Jarman&amp;quot;.
Apparently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jarmanrealestate.com/index.html&quot;&gt;he is a realtor for Sutton West Coast Realty&lt;/a&gt;.
He must be a very happy employee, because printed between his first and last name is a picture of him with an enormous grin on his face.
I am glad that he is choosing to share that happiness with me by sporadically giving me free notepads.
Geoff Jarman, I thank you.
You are a God amongst men.&lt;/p&gt;
